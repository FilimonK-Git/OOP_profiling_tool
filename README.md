# OOP_profiling_tool

This tool allows for performance comparison among object instantation patterns in JavaScript OOP

The five patterns investigated are:
	1	Functional Instantiation
	2	Functional Shared Instantiation
	3	Prototypal Instantiation
	4	PseudoClassical Instantiation
	5	ES6 Instantiation
  
The performance of each pattern can be assessed using a user-defined numeric input to generate a stack or queue data structure.

Visit the stack_patterns.html and queue_patterns.html to play around to generate stacks or queues. Use Performance tool in Chrome Dev Tools.

Test Cases (3-8-2022) I have ran each pattern using both data structure types (with 10,000 datapoints) and added screenshots of Chrome Dev tools performance panel in screenshots folder.
